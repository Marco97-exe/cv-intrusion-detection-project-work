# Computer Vision and Image Processing - Intrusion Detection

## Input video characteristics:
- 12 fps
- ~41s
- 320x240 pixels
- 8 bit/pixel (256 gray levels)

## Task 1 (mandatory):
### Graphical Output
For each frame the system should show labelled blobs (either by generating colored sections on black screen or their contours over the original video)
### Text Output
For each frame the system should print:
- Number of found objects
- Values associated to blob's features
- Classification into person / other

## Task 2 (optional)
Development of algorithm for distinguish between presence or absence of an object to ignore the removal of objects as new blobs
